Social Media Tourism 

In our day to day life we spend most of the time on social media browsing different
websites, online shopping and various pages for entertainment, which simply proves that
most of our free time we like to invest on internet. All the brands promote their products
on social media as no other platform is as booming as social media as it has become part
of nearly everyone's daily routine.
Predictive analytics is going to become increasingly popular - by analyzing the big data
from social media, companies will be able to identify the hallmarks of a customer who is
about to cease business with said company, and take efforts to correct it. They can also
identify common behaviors between different customers to see what makes them more
likely to become a power user or be completely on board with the company's ideals. They
can then use this information to convert social media users into customers of their
business. So here we have problem statement related to aviation industry, we will analyze
the given data using python and will perform univariate, bivariate analysis and EDA. In
this project we will try to predict and analyze the digital and social behavior of the
customers and provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted
customers who have a high propensity to take up the product.
